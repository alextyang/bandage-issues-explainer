      <p>Over <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2946087/">1 billion pounds of Pesticides</a> are used in the US each year, even as the country has programs regulating and limiting their use. Pesticides are designed to kill or suppress a variety of organisms, and are the primary mechanism for such in commercial farming.</p>

      <p>However, the enormous agricultural industry that manufactures them have a large incentive to make them seems as safe as possible. Exposure to pesticides is annually poisoning an estimated <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2946087/#R4">25 million workers</a> worldwide, and they contaminate the tap water of <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2946087/#R8">50 million Americans</a>.</p>
      <p>Pesticides wreak havoc on the environment, threatening biodiversity and weakening the natural systems upon which human survival depends. Over <a href="https://archive.org/details/sustainingearthi0000mill">98% of sprayed insecticides and 95% of herbicides reach a collatoral destination</a>, and infect water in runoff, soil, groundwater, and the air.</p>

      <p>We problematize certain organisms as pests because their role in the ecosystem is in conflict with economic productivity. However, factory farming in conflict with nature is not the only option. If agriculture was more integrated with the ecosystem, it wouldn't necessitate its rampant poisoning.</p>

        Integrated Pest Management works to make the farming account for the environment and prevent unnecessary pesticide use. Some methods include:
        <br><br>Soil Preparation: Growers give their plants a head start on pest problems by choosing the proper site, testing the soil, rotating crops, creating raised beds where necessary, and providing sufficient organic matter.
        <br><br>Planting: Growers plant crops that tolerate common problems, altering planting time and spacing to discourage certain diseases and insects.
        <br><br>Forecasting: Weather data are consulted to predict if and when pest outbreaks will occur. Treatments can then be properly timed, preventing crop damage and saving sprays.
        <br><br>Pest Trapping: Traps that are attractive to insects are used so that growers can pinpoint when the pest has arrived and decide whether control is justified.
        <br><br>Monitoring: Growers inspect representative areas of the fields regularly to determine whether pests are approaching a damaging level.
        <br><br>Thresholds: Before treating, growers wait until pest populations reach a scientifically determined level that could cause economic damage. Until that threshold is reached, the cost of yield and quality loss will be less than the cost for control.
        <br><br>Cultural Controls: The pest’s environment it then disrupted by turning under crop residues, sterilizing greenhouse tools, and harvesting early.
        <br><br>Biological Controls: It is necessary for growers to conserve the many beneficial natural enemies already at work. They import and use additional biologicals where effective.
        <br><br>Chemical Controls: Growers select the most effective and appropriate pesticide and properly calibrate sprayers. They then verify that weather conditions will permit good coverage without undue drift.
        <br><br>Recordkeeping: Records of pest traps, weather and treatment are kept for use in pest management decisions.</p>
